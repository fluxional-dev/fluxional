This work is inspired by the developers at [SST.DEV](https://docs.sst.dev/live-lambda-development).

Enable the following setting in your code:

```python

flux.settings.development.enable_local = True

```

Deploy your application:

<div class="bash-code">

```bash
$ fluxional deploy app.handler
```

</div>

Run your dev environment with

<div class="bash-code">
```bash
$ fluxional dev app.handler
```
</div>
